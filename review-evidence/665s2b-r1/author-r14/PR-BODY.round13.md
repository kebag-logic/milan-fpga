## Status

REVIEW READY at `4f58214f457e963243a1fe6b86c6af161e97f26f`. Round 13 of lane S2b, on round 12's `c954b8a9`: commits added on top, no rebase, no force, no merge. `dev-soft-core` is still `a68536fa`, which the head contains.

Every measured row the CPU decides and every pass fits at 100 MHz, at both points, in both arms, with the two drafts staged and without them, a save in progress and both links changing at once included: a save's flash step is now taken only in a pass that took no input and has 1.0 ms of the 2.0 ms share left, and SRP builds one interface a pass. The least margin is the 8x8 last SRP record's, 0.71 ms (17.29 ms against 18, arm B, in a save's window). The three egress-held rows stay with tsn-c-stack #26.

The 32x32 figures are an estimate, restated at this head, and they miss: the last AECP and SRP records and the per-pass share under every reading (section 14 of `SPLIT_CONTROL_MEMORY.md`).

## Description

### Round 13

Both round 12 reviews found passes over the 2.0 ms share that no group staged: a save's flash step beside a composed window's heaviest work, 2.39 and 2.72 ms at 8x8/2if, and both links changing together, 2.08 ms. The share is not amended; each is fixed in code, and each stale statement in text.

| Item | Change | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. A save in a composed window | THE STEP (`ctrl_loop.h`): the store's centisecond consumer only owes a step; the loop reads the store's clock as a pass starts and, after the polls of a pass that took no event and no record, hands the step the clock's value at which the pass has spent the share. The step is taken only while 1.0 ms (`NVM_STEP_US`) is left; otherwise it stays owed, once. THE SHARE names it | At round 12's head the review's windows reproduce exactly (x-save 2.388 ms, y-save 2.716 ms, y-links 2.081 ms). At this head `backlog-adp`'s window in each flash phase of a save at eight tick phases, both points, both arms, with and without the drafts: 0 of 99,289 passes over the share; a pass carrying a step at most 1.02 ms at 8x8 and 1.22 ms at 1x1. The planted store step (`--mutation store-step-unbounded`, 8x8, arm A): 15 of 24 windows over the share, the longest 2.71 ms, 5 of them with every row within its bound; `CONTROL store-step-unbounded caught` |
| 2. A joint link change | A poll builds one interface at most; the other on the next pass, and it goes first after that | `y-links` 1.76 / 1.82 ms (arm A / arm B), `x-links-same` 1.54 / 1.56 ms, no pass over. `Srp.JointLinkChangeBuildsOneInterfaceAPass` fails on the plant `joint-reset-builds-both` |
| 3. The boot simulation's flash window | The boot SoC on the product's uncached window (`milan_soc.ctrl_uncached_flash`); an export with another is refused; the self-test plants the call's removal | 1x1 25.515 ms, 8x8 64.885 ms to ready (24.660 and 64.271 ms through the cached window at `c954b8a9`, 25.413 and 65.026 ms with the window alone); `PLANT flash-window-cached: caught`, 3 of 3 plants caught |
| 4. Stale statements | The SRP README's share (2.0 ms), the AECP README's 20 ms service bound, the store README's cadence; the platform image's 58.5 tiles; the gPTP additions restated from the table's own units, each a mean or a bound | Section 14 of `SPLIT_CONTROL_MEMORY.md` |
| 5. Residue | A save's time to durable in absolute terms (here and in section 13); the harness README's arm B backlog rows; the interface reset clears `listener_present` (S1, accepted) | `Srp.InterfaceResetClearsListenerPresent`, plant `reset-keeps-listener-present` |

**The first fix was not enough, and its result is kept.** With the room gate alone every pass of the 14 save windows then graded fit, but at 8x8 the deferred read-backs landed in the passes that drain SRP's full ring, and the last SRP record took 18.02 to 18.21 ms against 18 in four blank-check windows. The step now waits for a pass that takes no input, so no record waits on it beyond the pass running when the record arrives.

**The store's steps,** one save with no other load, CPU cycles at 100 MHz, the flash port's and the store's in the step's pass, from a measurement-only build that prints every pass running the flash port (not on this branch):

| Step | 1x1/1if | 8x8/2if |
|---|---:|---:|
| Erase issue | 5,051 | 5,112 |
| Busy poll | 3,994 | 4,710 |
| Blank-check read-back, 128 bytes | 73,491 | 72,841 |
| Page program issue | 95,373 | 95,386 |
| Verify read-back, 128 bytes | 76,234 | 76,737 |

The longest, a page program's issue, is 0.954 ms, within the 1.0 ms the step is given.

**A save from the change to durable,** from the SET_NAME to the end of the step that reads back the container's last bytes, one save with no other load, on the harness's flash model, which has no busy time: at 8x8 4,697.1 ms at round 12's head and 4,697.4 ms at this head; at 1x1 2,018.4 ms. The blank check and the verify read back 128 bytes a tick, 104 ticks each at 8x8, 2.08 s of ticks where a whole page a step took 1.04 s before round 12. The owner's 0.5 s (#823) belongs to the append-only design in Mark II, not to this image, and this PR does not claim it.

**A save's progress.** The store steps only in a pass that took no input. In `backlog-adp`'s window at 8x8 a step owed as the window opened waited until its records had drained, at most 16.95 ms past its tick, and the ticks meanwhile owed it once, so a window delays a save by about a tick. Nothing here bounds that wait under input that never leaves a pass empty.

The tightest is the 8x8 last SRP record, 17.29 ms against 18, arm B: 0.43 and 0.83 ms more, arm A and arm B, than `backlog-adp`'s window with no save, since a step can be running when the window's records arrive.

Against round 12's head the 8x8 last SRP record rose from 15.88 / 15.96 to 16.56 / 16.46 ms: a pass of SRP's drain runs 68 more instructions, the clock read as each pass starts, but about 3,300 more CPU cycles, half of them instruction-fetch waits from the moved code layout, and the record waits sixteen passes.

**The per-pass share,** passes over it of the work passes, those that write nothing to the mailbox counted by their run's longest, and the longest in ms (arm A / arm B):

The rows that would not fit: the last AECP record under S, L and U by 8.1, 15.8 and 43.9 ms; the last SRP record by 13.4, 19.1 and 48.2 ms; the longest work pass at 3.5, 4.9 and 7.9 ms, over the share by 1.5, 2.9 and 5.9 ms; under U alone the first SRP record by 4.5 ms, the last ACMP, ADP and MAAP records by 13.3, 4.3 and 4.2 ms, an ACMP command behind a full ACMP ring by 8.0 ms.

**gPTP, a labelled assumption,** restated from the table's own units, a frame or a servo run each, 0.4 ms at 40,000 cycles: on a row 1.1 units, 0.45 ms, as a mean (62 units a second over 18 ms); 20 units, 8.0 ms, as a bound, all that can fall in 18 ms on two ports; on a pass 4 units, 1.6 ms, as a bound (two records a channel a pass). At 8x8/2if the last SRP record, 17.29 ms at its worst, keeps 0.26 ms under the mean and is 0.39 ms over at the range's top, 1.1 ms; the bound puts it 7.29 ms over. The longest pass, 1.98 ms, becomes 3.58 ms under the pass bound. So F6's records need their own room in the pass. At 32x32 the longest pass becomes 5.1 ms under S and 9.5 ms under U, and a Pdelay response, two passes, takes 10.2 ms under S, within Milan v1.2 4.2.6.2.6's 15 ms, and 18.9 ms under U, past it. Not measured: no gPTP firmware is linked here.

### Round 12

| Piece | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Merge | `dev-soft-core` `a68536fa`, contract 2.4 and dev's #806, #814, #818, #787 | Assigned. Three semantic conflicts follow below; each is its own commit |
| Split CPU clock | `milan_soc.CTRL_CPU_CD` `sys`, `ctrl_cpu_domain` refuses any other, no CPU clock of its own, no crossing | The owner's decision of 2026-10-30. The all-fabric CPU and the Milan datapath clock do not change |
| CPU budget harness | Built through `ctrl_cpu_cd`; `build.json` records `cpu_cd`, `cpu_hz`, `sys_hz`; a CPU anywhere else is refused, built or reused; the `--cpu-hz` option is retired | One clock, and no figure at another presented as the product's |
| Split boot simulation | The merged S3 harness still drove the CPU from the Milan clock: now `ctrl_cpu_cd`, the boot graded against the approved T_svc = 20 ms | Merge conflict in meaning: boot at 1x1 24.660 ms, 8x8 64.271 ms |
| Platform image | `ctrl_plat_image.py` built RV32I against the split link: now the split hart's flags and audits, with the record mover and the word-wide primitives; `ctrl_memory.LEDGERED`'s `ctrl_plat` size re-measured, 19,944 B, 58.0 RAMB36 within the ledgered 59.0 | Merge conflict in meaning: it no longer linked |
| SRP link change | `reset_interface` withdraws and destroys in the pass that takes it; the next pass's poll builds; SRP's receive waits; a pass of link edges builds once | It was the one 8x8 pass over the 2.0 ms share, 2.21 and 2.22 ms. Events a pass do not set it (labelled experiments: six 2.207 ms, four 2.108 ms) |
| Saved-state read-back | Blank check and verify read 128 bytes a step (`NVM_READ_BYTES`) | A whole page through the product's uncached window and lwSRP's periodic work in one tick put an 8x8 pass at 2.26 ms. A save's read-back takes twice as many ticks: at 8x8 the blank check and the verify are 2.08 s of ticks, and a save takes 4,697.1 ms from the change to durable (measured in round 13 at `c954b8a9`) |
| Harness flash window | Uncached and not executable but in the hybrid-XIP arm, refused otherwise | The cached window read the flash through the data cache, which the product never does: 12.39 ms at 8x8 and 4.07 ms at 1x1 for one pass in each save |
| Harness AECP pacing | Each frame waits a refill period of the channel's token bucket | At 100 MHz the groups outran the refill and the filter refused the frames past its burst: 3 refused probes at 1x1, 15 at 8x8 |
| The two refused windows | Each backlog window opens on a drained event ring; its table and any refusal give the records held at its opening | The window's definition was wrong, not the firmware: it named a population only a drained ring can take, and waited a fixed time for one. With k records held only 16 - k + 1 of the fifteen grandmaster changes commit |
| Docs | `ARCHITECTURE_HW_SW_SPLIT.md`, `SPLIT_CONTROL_MEMORY.md` sections 5, 11 to 13 and new 14, both harness READMEs, `MAILBOX_SPLIT.md`'s access bounds, the SRP, store and platform READMEs | Every figure names its clock. The bare-metal all-fabric image keeps its own clock contract |

The rows at round 12's head, `c954b8a9`, each family against min(T_svc = 20 ms, its 10 % ceiling); round 13 restates them above.

Out of context, the split CPU on `sys` closes at 100 MHz, WNS +1.605 ns, WHS +0.070 ns, 3,543 LUTs, 5,643 FFs, 9.5 tiles: 405 LUTs, 1,236 FFs and 5 tiles fewer than behind the crossing. The routed split image is lane S9's.

**The 1x1, 4 KiB windows.** At the CPU's 100 MHz, on a drained ring, all four commit their fifteen grandmaster changes with no record held. The composed maximum covers all four, so it is no longer partial: at least 40.25 ms, a lower bound while the two bound-talker windows close with SRP records unreleased.

**32x32 and gPTP** are restated at round 13's head above.

**One CPU, measured** at round 12's head. As built, the split placement already has one hart. The figures below are the split firmware on that hart, and on the SoC core as it ships, cacheless, on `sys` at 100 MHz, arm A. The cacheless core does not fit 8x8.

## How to get into the same state

```sh
git fetch origin
git checkout 4f58214f457e963243a1fe6b86c6af161e97f26f
git submodule update --init protocol-processor gptp-processor third_party/lwSRP third_party/tsn-c-stack third_party/verilog-axis
```

The harness's prerequisites are in `tb/verilator/ctrl_service_budget/README.md`: the product LiteX tree, the pinned RV32 SDK and Verilator, with `COURSIER_MODE=offline` and `SBT_OPTS=-Dsbt.offline=true`.

Expected result / pass criteria: each self-test reports 0 failures and every planted defect caught; the firmware self-test runs as shards 0/4 to 3/4. Each point grades every group, a save's 24 windows among them, with 0 refusals, 0 passes over the 2.0 ms share and only the three egress-held paths over budget, so without `--record-budget-findings` a run exits 1 on those alone. The planted store step prints `CONTROL store-step-unbounded caught`. The boot runs pass at both shapes, and the boot self-test catches 3 of 3 plants, `flash-window-cached` among them.

Evidence on the head, each on a clean clone, each rc 0: every `run:` step of docs.yml (64 ran; 31 hosted-only steps not run, each with its reason); the full sweep as four shards, 65 of 65 suites, 2,613,655 checks, 0 failures; the firmware self-test's four shards, 612 of 612 mutants caught in shard 1; the store's gate, 445 tests and 116 planted defects; firmware coverage; the harness self-test; the boot runs at both shapes and the boot self-test, 3 of 3 plants; the builder (its two arms that need another host not run, as before); behave, 508 scenarios; `git diff --check` against `a68536fa`. The harness's images rebuilt at the head equal the measured legs' (5 of 5). The sweep's first attempt stopped in every shard's preflight, `test_suite_cancellation.py`'s SIGINT case; the script alone passed, and the second attempt is the result above.

## Known limitations / out of scope

- **The 32x32 rows.** An estimate that misses, listed above. Nothing here builds 32x32.
- **For the owner, none decided here:** which lever closes the last AECP and SRP records and the share at 32x32 (the admitted rings and buckets, D4(b)'s two records a pass, the share, the per-stream polls); which CPU lever 4 means, since the split placement already has one hart; a clock past 100 MHz or a second hart if the firmware's levers do not close it.
- **A save's progress** depends on passes that take no input: in the heaviest window a step waited at most 16.95 ms. Nothing here bounds that wait under input that never leaves a pass empty.
- **The step's room:** the longest step, a page program's issue, is 0.954 ms of the 1.0 ms `NVM_STEP_US` gives it; a slower flash port or a longer step must restate that constant.
- **The least margin** is 0.71 ms, the 8x8 last SRP record with a save in progress; gPTP's assumed mean, 0.45 ms, fits it, its bound, 8.0 ms, does not.
- **The three egress-held rows** stay with tsn-c-stack #26.
- **The drafts** (lwSRP, tsn-c-stack) are measured staged and are not pinned here.
- **The platform image's hot list:** four entries name the size fixture's callbacks and place nothing in that image.
- **No fabric option outlives the switch-over:** nothing here adds one.
- The hybrid-XIP arm still misses T_svc on every path, so D3's rule stands.
